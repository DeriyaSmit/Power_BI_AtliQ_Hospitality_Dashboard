# Power_BI_Project_AtliQ-Hospitality-Dashboard
𝐀𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭:

This project was a part of a Codebasics resume project challenge. In this project, I had to provide insights to the revenue team of the AtliQ Grand hotel using some past historical data. So that they can improve revenue and market share in the hotel category as compared to other hotels.

𝐌𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐝𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐲:

➡️I started this project by loading the 📜𝐄𝐱𝐜𝐞𝐥 𝐟𝐢𝐥𝐞 into the 𝐏𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐐𝐮𝐞𝐫y

➡️Then I removed all the unwanted columns from the dataset so that the execution of the data becomes faster. I also checked for any null values or any missing values in the dataset and also checked for changes in the datatypes of the column. Then, I loaded the data to the 𝐏𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐕𝐢𝐞𝐰.

➡️After that, I created some extra columns in the table which were needed and also created one extra table for unique dates in the dataset. Then, I performed 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐦𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 so that the data can travel from one table to another table smoothly.

➡️Then I created some 𝐃𝐀𝐗 measures that would help to get meaningful insights from the data and also created some visuals to understand the data properly and to check where the hotel is having problems and how it can overcome those problems.

➡️Then published that report to the power bi service

𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐡𝐨𝐭𝐞𝐥 𝐢𝐬 𝐟𝐚𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐠:

🚩The hotel was using the Flat Pricing model for all the days whether it is a weekend or a weekday, because of which the hotel was not able to make more money when there is huge demand on the weekend.

🚩Also, the ADR (Average Daily Rate) is almost the same every month instead of having a peak month in India when everyone travels from one place to another.

🚩Another problem is that they are having bad ratings in some hotels, due to which they are facing difficulty in generating revenue from those hotels.

🚩The hotel is also not earning more on weekends (It earns 68.96% on weekdays and 31.04% on weekends). This should be even more on weekends because the occupancy rate is higher on weekends compared to weekdays.

🚩There are some hotel which are making more revenue in one city and in another city that same hotel is not make more revenue compared to the other city

𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐡𝐨𝐭𝐞𝐥 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦:

🚀Instead of using the Flat Pricing model, they can use a Dynamic pricing model and Pricing on type of day model to generate more revenue.

🚀Increasing their Occupancy% rate for every hotel.

🚀Checking why the customer gave the bad rating and fixing that problem because when the rating is bad, the customer does prefer to go to that hotel.

Metrices Used :
✅Revpar (Revenue per available room )
✅Occupany%
✅ADR (Average Daily Rate)
